# SIMPLE AR APP
A simple way to host your machine learning model on the web.

**Or so, it was supposed to be....**

This project started off based on this article [<sup>[1]</sup>][1] which shows you how to deploy your trained model to the web for free via Heroku. 

So, then using flask, I wrote a simple Face detector (Cascade classifier) project that works as intended locally. However, ran into a bunch of problems while deploying it to Heroku. Suffice to say I've lost interest after spending hours of scouring the web for troubleshooting and debugging., with no luck ! :frowning_face: :frowning_face:

But if anybody can assist or get it deployed to the web successfully, do share that secret sauce!
Please

**PS**
I tried switching to complete Javascript(Opencv.js), but there I couldn't even get the web page to load the classifier locally. Not sure what I'm missing there! :frowning_face:
